### Project Description
Relivio is a minimalist digital sanctuary designed to turn heavy thoughts into light. It guides users through a ritual of guided breathing, visual release (turning regrets into stars), and mindful grounding through humorous tasks and sensory games. It’s a quiet corner of the internet built for letting go, laughing, and finding a moment of peace.

### The Problem statement
Modern digital life leaves users overwhelmed by "digital baggage" and persistent thought loops, yet most wellness tools feel like clinical chores. Relivio solves this by providing a ritualistic sanctuary that uses sensory grounding and visual metaphors to transform heavy regrets into a calming, interactive experience of release.

### The Solution
Relivio solves digital overwhelm by replacing clinical routines with a three-step "Ritual of Release." It uses guided breathing to regulate the nervous system, an "ember engine" that visually transforms typed regrets into a permanent constellation of light, and mindful games that use a user's own emotional triggers (via emoji-popping) to provide a sense of tangible, sensory relief.

#### Screenshots (Add at least 3)

image1
The image showcases the Breathing Gatekeeper, the initial phase of the Relivio sanctuary. It features a glowing, pulsing gold ring that synchronizes with the text "Breath In" to guide users through a meditative breathing cycle. This minimalist interface serves to physically regulate and center the user before they begin the process of releasing their digital regrets.

image2
This stage, titled "Release to the Stars," is where the core emotional work happens. Users are provided with a private text area to "write their weight"—be it a regret, anxiety, or heavy thought. Upon clicking "Ignite and Release," the platform utilizes its "Ember Engine" to visually transform that text into glowing stars, providing a symbolic sense of lightness and letting go.

image3
After the emotional release, the platform uses light humor to pull the user back into the physical world. Users are encouraged to "prove they are a functioning human" by completing simple tasks like relaxing their shoulders or drinking water before entering the "Zen Zone".

image4
The final stage provides an interactive "Pop Your Emotions" sensory game. Users tap various themed emojis—such as broken hearts or wilted flowers—to "let go," with each pop generating a small burst of light.

image5
The "Journaling Sanctuary" offers a private, long-form writing space for deeper reflection. Users can document their feelings and click "Save Journal" to keep a record of their emotional growth during the session.
